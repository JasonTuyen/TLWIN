  <h2><s>Team Curse</s></h2><p>Before Team Liquid was Team Liquid they were known by the   name of Team Curse. Aside from the team name, there was another curse that followed the organization: The Forever Fourth <s>Meme</s> Curse. Throughtout the team's history there was nothing other than 4th place finishes. Due to a number of reasons Owner Steve Arhancet rebranded as Team Liquid in 2015 and the new organization prepares in hopes to break the curse. Watch the video for info about the rebrading or read <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2psxoh/team_curse_being_renamed_in_2015/">here</a>.</p><iframe width="400" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zwGjMxZZeMo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  <h2>Roster 2015</h2><p>Making up Team Liquid's first roster was Quas, IWDominate, FeniX, Piglet, and Xpecial. Despite being a new team, the players are no strangers to the game. Quas and IWD both played for Team Curse, Xpecial has been a long time vertan of the game, FeniX had played in Korea under the name Miso for Jin Air, and Piglet is a Season 3 World Champion.</p><img src= "https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQldYsciKDtgsylAmvBOsHJEQJUgmvLtJZl8OacfW_xnSVV81_S4A">
  
  <h2>Spring Split 2015</h2><p>Starting the spring Piglet was unable to play due to Visa issues, so TL fielded sub KEITHMCBRIEF. The team finished the first week 2-0 and looked strong even with a sub. With the return of Piglet the team was not doing too well causing TL to sub in Keith for two more weeks. After a short break Piglet returns and the team finishes the split tied at 9-9 and enters the Playoffs at 6th seed after a tie-breaker match with Team8. The team entered playoffs with a clean 3-0 vs CLG. In the semi-finals TL started 2-0 against C9 before getting reverse swept. Following the lost the team enters the 3rd place match against TIP. Liquid was then able to beat Impluse in an intense 5 game match for 3rd place.</p><img src= "http://i.imgur.com/JPinNS2.jpg" width=500> 
  
  <h2>Summer Split 2015</h2><p>After having played a split together, TL gets ready to take on the Summer Split with their talented roster. Liquid dominated the summer split and ended the split with 13-5 record and a tie against CLG. After they defeated CLG for the 1st place bye they faced a renewed TSM in the semis. TL was forced to play for 3rd place once again after losing 3-1 to TSM. Once again TL faced TIP in a third place match, however this time TL were able to win the series 3-1. Despite another 3rd place finish the Team could not go to Worlds due to CLG beating TSM in the finals. Because of TSM's lost to CLG, TL had to play in the gauntlet for the last NA slot at worlds. TL faced a miracle C9 team in the gauntlet that had just won 2 reverse sweeps back to back. TL was only able to take one game off of C9 this series. C9 had beaten TL 3-1 and had earned the last slot to Worlds.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7PulGG4PSE4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  
  <h2>Ten Man Roster</h2><p>During the offseason there was a plethora of roster changes for many teams, Liquid included. TL support Xpecial was the first to leave the roster and top laner Quas leave a few months later.Replacing the two would be ex-TDK support Smoothie and ex-CLGBlack top laner Lourlo. Also joining Team Liquid would be TL's sister team Liquid Academy. After the recent success of the Academy team, owner Liquid112 decided to field a 10-man roster consisting of the main team and the academy team. </p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bEoc3ZD2nSw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  
  <h2>Spring Split 2016</h2><p>The first game of the 2016 split resulted in a Team Liquid lost. Shortly after the match TL Jungler IWDominate announced retirement and TLA Dardoch was sent to replace IWDominate for Day2. TLA support Matt also joined the main roster with Dardoch as the two are the shotcalling duo of the academy team. For the rest of the split TL made no substitutions and despite a rough early split had picked themselves up by the end of the split. The team finished in 4th place with 10-8 record. Liquid started the playoffs with a 3-0 win against 5th place NRG. The team would then lose a close 3-2 series against defending NALCS champions CLG (who are once again the NALCS champions). The team is once again fighting for 3rd place, and their opponent is the regular split 1st place Team Immortals. Liquid take a beating and loses 3-0 to Immortals.</p><img src= "https://dqrt72khb0whk.cloudfront.net/uploads/image/file/8601/cropped_25894095626_ae267e0d45_k.jpg?ts=1458528773" height=250 width=500>
