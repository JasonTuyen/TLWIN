However, Reignover was not always the best. He started his career in Korea as one of the worst. In 2015 he was picked up by Fnatic Gaming (FNC) to play in the EULCS. Under FNC Reignover had won the both the spring and summer EULCS splits. He also became a World's semifinalist under FNC. For 2016, Reignover moved to the NALCS to play under Team Immortals who placed 3rd place for both splits. During the offseason Team Liquid and Team Immortals came to an agreement to trade jungers. Thus in 2017 Reignover became Team Liquid's starting jungler.</p></div>

      <h2><s>Team Curse</s></h2><p>Before Team Liquid was 

Team Liquid they were known by the   name of Team Curse. Aside from the team name, there was another curse that 

followed the organization: The Forever Fourth <s>Meme</s> Curse. Throughtout the team's history there was nothing 

other than 4th place finishes. Due to a number of reasons Owner Steve Arhancet rebranded as Team Liquid in 2015 and 

the new organization prepares in hopes to break the curse. Watch the video for info about the rebrading or read <a

      <h2>Roster 2015</h2><p>Making up Team Liquid's first roster was Quas, 

IWDominate, FeniX, Piglet, and Xpecial. Despite being a new team, the players are no strangers to the game. Quas 

and IWD both played for Team Curse, Xpecial has been a long time vertan of the game, FeniX had played in Korea 

under the name Miso for Jin Air, and Piglet is a Season 3 World Champion.</p><img src= "https://encrypted-

      <h2>Spring 

Split 2015</h2><p>Starting the spring Piglet was unable to play due to Visa issues, so TL fielded sub KEITHMCBRIEF. 

The team finished the first week 2-0 and looked strong even with a sub. With the return of Piglet the team was not 

doing too well causing TL to sub in Keith for two more weeks. After a short break Piglet returns and the team 

finishes the split tied at 9-9 and enters the Playoffs at 6th seed after a tie-breaker match with Team8. The team 

entered playoffs with a clean 3-0 vs CLG. In the semi-finals TL started 2-0 against C9 before getting reverse 

swept. Following the lost the team enters the 3rd place match against TIP. Liquid was then able to beat Impluse in 

an intense 5 game match for 3rd place.</p><img src= "http://i.imgur.com/JPinNS2.jpg" width=500>   
      <h2>Summer 

Split 2015</h2><p>After having played a split together, TL gets ready to take on the Summer Split with their 

talented roster. Liquid dominated the summer split and ended the split with 13-5 record and a tie against CLG. 

After they defeated CLG for the 1st place bye they faced a renewed TSM in the semis. TL was forced to play for 3rd 

place once again after losing 3-1 to TSM. Once again TL faced TIP in a third place match, however this time TL were 

able to win the series 3-1. Despite another 3rd place finish the Team could not go to Worlds due to CLG beating TSM 

in the finals. Because of TSM's lost to CLG, TL had to play in the gauntlet for the last NA slot at worlds. TL 

faced a miracle C9 team in the gauntlet that had just won 2 reverse sweeps back to back. TL was only able to take 

one game off of C9 this series. C9 had beaten TL 3-1 and had earned the last slot to Worlds.</p><iframe width="560"

<h2>Ten Man Roster</h2><p>During the offseason there was a plethora of roster changes for many teams, Liquid 

included. TL support Xpecial was the first to leave the roster and top laner Quas leave a few months 

later.Replacing the two would be ex-TDK support Smoothie and ex-CLGBlack top laner Lourlo. Also joining Team Liquid 

would be TL's sister team Liquid Academy. After the recent success of the Academy team, owner Liquid112 decided to 

field a 10-man roster consisting of the main team and the academy team. </p><iframe width="560" height="315"

      <h2>Spring Split 

2016</h2><p>The first game of the 2016 split resulted in a Team Liquid lost. Shortly after the match TL Jungler 

IWDominate announced retirement and TLA Dardoch was sent to replace IWDominate for Day2. TLA support Matt also 

joined the main roster with Dardoch as the two are the shotcalling duo of the academy team. For the rest of the 

split TL made no substitutions and despite a rough early split had picked themselves up by the end of the split. 

The team finished in 4th place with 10-8 record. Liquid started the playoffs with a 3-0 win against 5th place NRG. 

The team would then lose a close 3-2 series against defending NALCS champions CLG (who are once again the NALCS 

champions). The team is once again fighting for 3rd place, and their opponent is the regular split 1st place Team 

Immortals. Liquid take a beating and loses 3-0 to Immortals.</p><img src=

      <h2>Summer 2016</h2><p>During the Summer Split of Season 6, internal problems led to changes among the team roster. Team Liquid Academy's Moon, replaced Dardoch in the jungler position for a short time. Shortly later Dardoch returned to the starting line-up. With Dardoch's return Piglet was demoted to Team Liquid's academy team essentially trading spots with Fabbbyyy the previous academy team's ad carry. Team Liquid would run the line up of Lourlo, Dardoch, Fenix, Fabbbyyy, and Matt until playoffs. Team Liquid finished the split in 5th/6th place after a lost to CLG in the quarterfinals. During this time Team Liquid also fielded two other players Arcsecond (jungler) and Jynthe (ad carry) to try and solve the interal roster problem.</p>
      <h2>Breaking Point</h2><p>Team Liquid's video production team <a href="https://1upstudios.gg/">1UP Studios</a> alongside Team Liquid management released a video explaining the internal problems that took place within Team Liquid during the 2016 season.</p>
