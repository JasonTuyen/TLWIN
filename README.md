Team Liquid (League of Legends NALCS team) tribute website.  Just a tribute website that I made for my favorite NALCS team, Team Liquid. So far there are two versions, one from around March 2016 and the other from around October 2016. The two versions showcase my html/css growth in a span of about 6 months.  

The most recent version can be seen here:  
To-Do List: Revisions to V.2. and Start on a V.3.

Put on hold i guess. 9/1/2018
